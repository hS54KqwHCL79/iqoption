   In order to withdraw Bitcoins, you have to set up a Bitcoin wallet, if you haven’t done so yet. There are countless options available online. Please note that any withdrawal will be associated with a withdrawal fee. As a security precaution the company limits the cryptocurrency withdrawal amount to the amount of the deposit made from the card using a 3D-Secure password. For example, to withdraw $500 worth of Bitcoin you need to make sure you have deposited not less than $500 from your card through a 3D Secure password. You may also have to upload copies of your documents in colour if you haven’t attached them before.</div>

Scope of action</strong></p><p>1.1. This Agreement applies to the Customers who trade Contracts for Differences (CFDs).</p><p><strong>2. Types of Orders for dealing with Contracts for Differences (CFDs)</strong></p><p>2.1. With the help of the Company, the following Orders can be placed to work with CFDs: market orders and pending orders.</p><p><strong>3. Orders Execution</strong></p><p>3.1. In order to open a position in the Platform, the Client must open either a Purchase or a Sell at the price offered in the Platform at the time of such an Operation. In order to close a position, the Client must offer to sell (in the case of a Purchase) or purchase (in the case of a Sale) a Base asset covered by such an Open Position at the price offered in the Platform during such closing. The parties agree that every time when the Client places an Order, the Company independently executes such an Order as a counterparty. However, the Company has the right to hedge Customer Orders with the help of a third party.</p><p>3.2. The platform provides a purchase and sale price offer for each Underlying Asset in the Platform. The Client is aware that at the opening of the Purchase or the closing of the Sale (or vice versa), he can perform this operation only at the price offered in the Platform for the acquisition of such Underlying Asset. Orders may be placed and (if permitted) changed during the Stock Exchange session for each type of Underlying Asset appearing in the Platform and / or on the Website, subject to changes periodically made by the Company.</p><p>3.3. In the Platform, the Client has the right to make an offer to open the Position at the best price available in the Platform (hereinafter referred to as the "Market Order") at the time of opening such position, unless the Client specifies a certain price at which the offer to open a position should be made (hereinafter - "Limit order"). As for the Market Order, the price at which the Operation was completed may not always exactly coincide with the rate displayed at the time of placing the Order. The Client agrees that his offer to place the Market Order may be accepted at a lower or higher price than the price specified by him in the Market Order within a certain range, which is periodically indicated in the Platform. If the Client decides to place the Market Order, then his offer will be accepted at the best possible price offered in the Platform.</p><p>3.4. As for the Limit Order, the price at which the Operation is completed may not always exactly match the price displayed when the Order is placed. The Client agrees that his offer to open the Limit Order may be taken at a lower price in the case of a Purchase or at a higher price in the event of a Sale than the price specified by him in his Limit Order, which is periodically indicated on the Platform. If the Client proposes to open a Limit Order, then his offer can be accepted at the price specified by him in his order. At any time before the Limit Order is taken, the Client can cancel the Limit Order without any subsequent responsibility. If the Client opens a Limit Order, then his offer will be accepted at the best possible price offered in the Platform.</p><p>3.5. The Customer agrees that the Company may hedge or otherwise compensate for any Operation with the help of third parties in order to compensate for any liability or risk associated with any Transaction (s) of the Customer. In the event that the Company can not hedge Customer Operations with the help of third parties, the Company retains the right to make changes to the content or terms of the Order for work with CFD, including the expiration date, trading session or any other parameters in the details tab tools. </p><p>3.6. Unfilled Pending orders remain valid for the next trading session (if applicable).</p><p>3.7. Market orders that have not been executed because of insufficient volume required for their execution, become invalid and are canceled.</p><p>3.8. All open spot positions are prolonged for the next Business Day as of the end of the operational day of the corresponding Underlying Market, provided that the Company has the rights to close open spot positions. Any open forward positions are prolonged after the corresponding period for the next appropriate period, provided that the Company has the rights to close open forward positions.</p><p>3.9. The validity of the Order is determined in accordance with the type and time of the placed Order, according to the Client's instructions. If the validity of the Order is not specified, then it must remain valid for an unlimited period. However, the Company may delete one or all of the Pending Orders if the Customer's account value reaches zero.</p><p>3.10. Orders can not be canceled after they are placed. Pending orders can be deleted or modified until they are executed.</p><p>3.11. The client can change the expiry date of the Pending Order until it is executed, for which the Order must be canceled and a new Order must be placed.</p><p>3.12. Orders Stop-loss and Take-profit can be changed while they are above a certain level (depending on the trade symbol).</p><p>3.13. The open position of the CFD, which the Client holds in relation to a certain Underlying Asset and subsequently partially closes, will be closed in the order of receipt (known as FIFO) in a series of transactions that are made to form a specific position.</p><p>3.14. Unless otherwise specified in this Agreement, the Company does not have any obligations to monitor or advise the Client on the status of the Operation or to close any of the Client's Open Positions. If the Company decides to provide these services, it is done at the discretion of the Company and is not considered as taking on further obligations to provide such services. The client must always be aware of the positions he has opened.</p><p><strong>4. Price offers</strong></p><p>4.1. In the event that the Company can not process the Order in connection with its price or size or for any other reason related to the type of Customer Account, the Company sends a repeated price offer. The number of repeated price offers is displayed in the Platform.</p><p>4.2. Price proposals appearing in the Client terminal are indicative and are based on the corresponding Base market. However, if there is high volatility in the Base Market, execution of the Order can be changed, and the Customer can receive the first price that will be available in the market, rather than the market price that he requested.</p><p>4.3. The Company provides Price offers taking into account the price of the Underlying Asset, but this does not mean that these Price offers are within a certain percentage of the price of the Underlying Asset. When the relevant Base Market is closed, the Price offers provided by the Company reflect the current purchase and sale prices of the Underlying asset at this time from the Company's point of view. The Client is aware that such Price offers will be established by the Company at its own discretion.</p><p><strong>5. Orders Stop-loss, Slip stop order</strong></p><p>5.1. The Client agrees to be fully responsible for the execution of trading operations performed using the Client's trading terminal, such as the Slip Stop Order, because they directly depend on its trading terminal, while the Company does not bear any responsibility in this regard.</p><p>5.2. The Client agrees that placing the Order Stop-Loss does not guarantee the limitation of losses up to the planned level, as the execution of the Order at the stipulated price may not be possible due to market conditions, and the Company does not bear any responsibility in this regard.</p><p>5.3. The Customer can add the "Close with a loss" or "Close with a profit" price at any stage when the position is Open.</p><p>5.4. When the Customer places the Limit Order, the Client authorizes the Company to close the Operation at a price of Close with a loss or at a price Close with a profit, whichever is applicable, and in accordance with the Order, without receiving further instructions from the Customer or sending notices to the Customer. The Company may close the Transaction when the price offered by the Company in the Trading Platform is equal to or greater than the price accepted by the Company for such Order.</p><p>5.5. The Client is aware that the initial price level established for the Order Close with a loss may be changed in connection with the movement of the market in the Platform in favor of the Client. While his Slip Order "Close with a loss" is still valid, the Client agrees that every change in the market of at least a hundredth of a percentage point (referred to as "Pips") in his favor must be accompanied by the Client's proposal to increase the level of his Slip Order "Close with a loss" on one-hundredth of a percentage point. Changes to one Pip will be rounded to the nearest absolute value in the Customer's Account Currency.</p><p>5.6. The Client understands and agrees that due to market volatility and factors beyond the control of the Company, the Company can not guarantee execution of the Order at the level specified for the Client's Order, for example, the Order may be closed at a price less attractive than the price originally specified by the Client for such Order. In this case, the Company will close the Operation at the next best price. For example, in the case of the Order "Close with a loss", in the event of the closure of a Purchase, the price of the Underlying Asset may suddenly rise above the price of the Order "Close with a loss" without reaching such a price. In the event of closing of the Sale, the price of the Underlying Asset may suddenly fall below the price of the Order "Close with a loss", not reaching such a price.</p><p>5.7. With regard to the Order "Close with Profit", when the price for the Underlying Asset is moving in favor of the Client (for example, if the price goes down, when the Customer buys, or the price goes up, when the Client sells), the Customer agrees that the Company can count such an improvement in price in favor of the Client.</p><p>5.8. Guaranteed Stop orders are available only for certain Basic Assets, as indicated in the "Tool Items" tab. If the Customer places a Guaranteed Stop Order for a new Order, the Company guarantees that when its purchase price or the proposed price reaches or falls below the closing price with the loss indicated by the Customer, this will close the position exactly at the price that the Client specified for the Guaranteed Stop Order. The open position may be closed in accordance with this Agreement until the price level of the Guaranteed Stop Order is reached. The following additional conditions apply to the guaranteed stop order: (a) A guaranteed stop order can only be requested for a new Order and only under the conditions of "Close with a loss"; (b) A guaranteed stop order may be activated or modified only during trading and subject to the availability of the underlying asset in the Platform; (c) Once the Guaranteed Stop Order is accepted by us, it can not be removed, only the price can be changed; (d) The guaranteed stop order must be placed at the minimum distance (determined by the Company) from the current price of the Underlying Asset proposed by the Company; (e) As the Company guarantees to close the price, the spread is adjusted for additional collection when the Guaranteed Stop Order is placed. The adjustment spread is displayed in the "Details of the Underlying Asset" tab for each relevant Instrument during the placement of the Guaranteed Stop Order.</p><p><strong>6. Evecution time</strong></p><p>6.1. The Company may establish the Date and Time of the expiration of a certain Underlying Asset. This should be displayed in the Platform. The Customer agrees that the verification of the Date and Time of Expiration is his responsibility.</p><p>6.2. If the Customer does not close an open Position relating to the Underlying Asset for which the Expiration Date is set before this Date, the Open Position will automatically be closed when the Expiration Date comes. The open position will be closed at the last price offered at the last moment before the corresponding Date and expiration time.</p><p>6.3. The client is aware that a certain Base Market can become volatile or illiquid without warning. In such circumstances, it may not be possible to execute the Customer Orders, especially in the period just before the expiry.</p><p><strong>7. Premium</strong></p><p>7.1. Any Open position at the end of the trading day or after the weekend should be automatically transferred to the next business day to avoid automatic closing and liquidation of the Operation. The Client is aware that when such an Operation is postponed to the next business day, the Swap transaction will either be added or withdrawn from its Customer Account taking into account such an Open Position. The information relating to the Premium for each Underlying Asset is displayed in the Platform. When deciding to open a position, the Client confirms that he is aware of the Premium. A Swap Commission is charged daily from the Customer Account. The operation is performed at 23.29 (time by server) and may take several minutes.</p><p>7.2. The Customer authorizes the Company to add or withdraw a premium commission to or from the Client's Account for any open Transaction to which such a commission has been credited in accordance with the applicable rate each day during the collection specified in the Platform for each Underlying Asset, respectively.</p><p>7.3. The company has the right, at its discretion, to make periodic changes in respect of settlement days and interest from premium. Such changes should be reflected in the Platform and / or on the Website, and the Customer is responsible for regularly checking up the updated information.</p><p><strong>8. Spreads</strong></p><p>8.1. All CFDs available through the Company have spreads that are displayed in the Platform and / or on the Website. The company has the right to periodically change its spreads at its discretion. Such changes should be reflected in the Platform and / or on the Website of leomarkets.com, and the Customer is responsible for regularly verifying the updated information.</p><p>9. Margin requirements</p><p>9.1. The Customer must provide and maintain the Initial Margin and / or Margin to open and maintain a position in such a limit as the Company may, at its sole discretion, establish at any time under the Conditions of Agreement for each type of CFD.</p><p>9.2. The client must make sure that he understands how the margin requirements are calculated.</p><p>9.3. In case there were no Force Majeure circumstances, the Company has the right to change the Margin Requirements by providing the Client with Written Notification for 10 (ten) Business Days before making these changes in respect of open positions. For new positions, the Company may amend the Margin Requirements by providing a Written Notification within one Business Day prior to their entry into force. All changes must be displayed in the Platform and / or on the Website, and the Customer is responsible for verifying the updated information.</p><p>9.4. The Company has the right to change the Margin Requirements without prior notification in the event of Force Majeure. In this case, the Company has the right to apply new Marginal requirements to new positions and to positions that have already been opened.</p><p>9.5. Without prejudice to clause 13.1. of the Customer Agreement, the Company has the right to close and / or limit the amount of the Customer's open position (New or Gross) and to reject the Customer's orders to open new positions in any of the following cases: (a) Customer's cost of collateral falls below the minimum margin requirement. At any time, the capital (current balance, including open positions) is equal to or lower than the specified percentage of the margin (collateral) required to maintain an open position. (b) The Company sends a Margin Call, but the Customer does not comply with this requirement.</p><p>9.6. The Company shall send the Client a Margin requirement automatically through the Platform, when the Margin on its Client Account reaches a certain percentage. When the Platform issues a warning to the Client about the achievement of a certain percentage of the Margin on the Customer's Account, the Client must take any or all of the following three actions to resolve the situation: (a) Limit your risk (close trade); or (b) hedge their positions (open positions that are opposite to those that it currently has), for the time of re-analysis of the situation; or (c) Add additional funds to your Customer Account.</p><p>9.7. If the Customer does not take any actions in accordance with clause 9.6 or if the Customer reaches 15% of the Margin on the Customer's Account, then his positions will automatically close (15% - the Level of forced closing of positions), starting from the most unprofitable Orders, and the Company has the right to refuse The client in placing new Orders.</p><p>9.8.
